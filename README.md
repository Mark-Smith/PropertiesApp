# PropertiesApp

1) All text view and label fon sizes can be changed, and the layout will adapt accordingly.
2) RestKit used through-out for download and persitence of data.


Issues:
1) Need to embed detail scene contents in a scroll view.
2) Need to show page indicators in embedded page view controller (which shows the images.
3) Need to add activity indicator to each of the child image view controllers.
4) Need to redraw each child image controller immediately when it's image has been downloaded.
Note: In hindsite, given the limited time I had given myself to this project, I probably should have used an appropriate third party library.
5) Need to tweak adaptable layout for all screen resolutions/sizes. At the moment, I only tested on iPhone 6 portrait.
